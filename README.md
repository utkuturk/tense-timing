# Tense Planning Project

This project investigates the dissociation between syntactic planning (tense feature/diacritic selection) and phonological planning (morph realization) in language production.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`experiments/`**: Contains the source code and materials for psycholinguistic experiments.
  - `conceptual-task/`: A PCIbex experiment testing tense planning using a switch task paradigm.
  - `morphophonology/`: (Planned) Experiment focusing on phonological planning.
  - `morphosyntax/`: (Planned) Experiment focusing on syntactic planning.
- **`analysis/`**: Scripts and notebooks for data analysis and stimulus generation.
  - `regular_irregular_freqmatch.ipynb`: Notebook for matching verb frequencies. <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/utkuturk/tense-timing/blob/main/analysis/regular_irregular_freqmatch.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
  - `experiment_materials_generator.ipynb`: Notebook for generating experiment materials. <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/utkuturk/tense-timing/blob/main/analysis/experiment_materials_generator.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
- **`presentations/`**: Slides and posters for conferences and talks.
  - `bling/`: Presentation materials for BLING.
- **`paper/`**: Manuscripts, drafts, and figures for publication.
- **`notes/`**: Research notes, meeting minutes, and literature reviews.
- **`doc/`**: Additional project-level documentation.

## Getting Started

### Conceptual Task
To run or edit the main experiment, navigate to `experiments/conceptual-task/`.
See the [Experiment README](experiments/conceptual-task/README.md) for details on the design, conditions, and deployment.

## Research Goals

1. **Overall Goal**: Test dissociation between syntactic and phonological planning.
2. **Current Focus**: Establish that the entropy-manipulation (switch task) works as intended using the `conceptual-task`.
