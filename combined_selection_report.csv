"chef_build_tower","chef","build","irregular","v1",66.8,31,"keep",45,"unclear","The character is placing a block on top of the tower, which is not a very dynamic action, making it feel slightly staged.; The tower's construction implies some level of completion or progression."
"chef_carry_box","chef","carry","regular","v5",69.6,33,"keep",45,"unclear","The chef is simply carrying a box, not actively doing anything to it. This feels more like a state of being rather than an action.; The chef's pose is somewhat static, lacking dynamism."

"chef_dig_hole","chef","dig","irregular","v1",68.6,24,"maybe",,"unclear","Pile of material next to the hole suggests a result state (the hole exists, there is a pile next to it); The chef is moving material, suggesting it is already partly done; Hole is already dug - completion evidence."
"chef_drag_sack","chef","drag","practice","v1",68.2,32,"keep",45,"unclear","The slight movement from the bag touching the floor hints at some prior progress or a dragging action, which impacts the 'no result states' score slightly."
"chef_drink_coffee","chef","drink","irregular","v1",91.4,32,"keep",,"unclear","The action of 'smelling' is not as dynamic as other actions, and this image isn't easily perceived as mid-action.; It's difficult to describe this as an action with a clear past or future tense; it feels more like a state (the chef is smelling coffee/tea)."
"chef_eat_apple","chef","eat","irregular","v1",62.5,28,"maybe",45,"unclear","The chef is just holding the apple. There is no dynamic eating action, so it is just before.; Apple orientation might suggest intent or direction of action - slight bias.; Tense usage is a bit biased towards future tense - more natural to say the chef 'will' eat the apple, as he's just holding it."

"chef_peel_banana","chef","peel","regular","v5",82.9,29,"maybe",,"unclear","The banana has already been partially peeled. This introduces a slight sense of completion.; The action of 'slicing/cutting' isn't clear enough. It appears the chef is preparing to cut the banana but isn't actually doing so at this moment. Feels anticipatory. The knife is placed almost touching the banana."

"chef_read_book","chef","read","irregular","v2",66.8,31,"maybe",45,"unclear","The chef is holding a book but not reading. It's not clear what action is being performed - just holding a book is not really an action.; The book is closed and pristine, but the chef isn't actively opening or closing it, so there's no clear action being performed."

"chef_smell_flower","chef","smell","regular","v1",75.7,32,"keep",60,"ambiguous","The chef is smelling a flower. It's an action but not dynamic.; The flower is being smelled, but the image is relatively static - could be better for 'will smell' than 'smelled'."
"chef_spin_top","chef","spin","practice","v3",91.4,32,"keep",,"unclear","The spinning top could suggest that the action has already been in progress to reach that stage.; The chef is leaning towards the spinning top, it could suggest it's about to spin more than currently spinning."

"chef_sweep_floor","chef","sweep","irregular","v1",77.1,27,"maybe",,"unclear","There is dirt/dust being swept up, which implies a result state of the action.; The 'will sweep' tense feels more natural; 'swept' implies a cleaner area."
"chef_wash_dish","chef","wash","regular","v3",91.4,32,"keep",,"unclear","Water droplets suggest ongoing action, which biases towards present tense.; The sponge is already sudsy, suggesting action has already been taking place.; The plate looks like it may have already had food on it; a clean plate would suggest 'will wash' more strongly."

"pirate_build_tower","pirate","build","irregular","v3",61.1,27,"maybe",45,"unclear","Slightly feels like the tower is already built - hints at completion.; Hands are close to the object, a slight anticipatory setup.; The wood block appears to be already slightly misaligned. Is this an indication it has been in play for a while?"
"pirate_carry_box","pirate","carry","regular","v4",74.3,31,"keep",60,"ambiguous","The character looks slightly strained, hinting at past duration of carrying the box.; Box shows no signs of wear and tear, which is good.; The tense 'will carry' sounds slightly more natural than 'carried'."

"pirate_dig_hole","pirate","dig","irregular","v4",56.8,24,"maybe",45,"unclear","Hole is already present, implying completion of digging to some extent.; Dirt pile suggests a result state of the digging action.; Pose is slightly anticipatory - could be about to dig."

"pirate_eat_apple","pirate","eat","irregular","v5",63.9,29,"maybe",45,"unclear","The character is holding the apple, but is not in the act of eating, thus not in mid-action.; The character looks like he will eat the apple, leans towards future tense more."
"pirate_paint_canvas","pirate","paint","regular","v2",66.8,31,"maybe",45,"unclear","The image is better suited to a future tense.; The paintbrush is held, not necessarily mid-stroke, but it does look like the pirate is about to paint rather than painting right now.; There is no evidence the pirate has painted before but it looks like the action is about to begin."
"pirate_peel_banana","pirate","peel","regular","v5",91.4,32,"keep",,"unclear","The pirate's pose is somewhat static, not clearly showing him acting.; It is implied that the pirate is about to eat the bananas, so it leans anticipatory.; The action itself feels a bit ambiguous - is he peeling, eating, or simply holding the bananas?"

"pirate_shake_bottle","pirate","shake","irregular","v4",85.7,30,"maybe",,"unclear","The bottle appears to be moving or being shaken. This creates a sense of anticipation for an imminent action.; The way the character is gripping the bottle creates the impression that something is about to happen rather than it currently happening. The shaking of the bottle is suggestive of "about to"."

"pirate_sweep_floor","pirate","sweep","irregular","v4",74.3,26,"maybe",,"unclear","Some dirt/dust particles are on the ground that imply the cleaning is underway, and it seems the character has been sweeping already.; The action may be construed as preparation for future sweeping since it is not a clear mid-action."

"wizard_build_tower","wizard","build","irregular","v2",80.0,28,"maybe",,"unclear","The wizard's hand positions give a slightly 'about to' or 'just finished' feeling. He is either about to place the block, or just removed it.; The structure of the wooden blocks has been somewhat constructed already, which could be interpreted as a state of completion, even though the action is technically in progress."

Fails both_tenses test.; The pile of dirt implies the wizard has already been digging for a while, even though there is no exhaustion shown, or duration cues."
"wizard_drag_sack","wizard","drag","practice","v1",63.9,29,"maybe",45,"unclear","The bag has a star on it, making it less fresh.; There are dust clouds, which are results of the action.; The wizard is clearly pulling something, but what he's pulling lacks clarity. It could be interpreted as having pulled something, reducing the image's ambiguity."
"wizard_drink_coffee","wizard","drink","irregular","v5",88.6,31,"maybe",,"unclear","The wizard is holding a mug of steaming liquid. The action is 'drink', but he is only holding the mug, not actively drinking. This makes it difficult to conceptualize the action. It seems less 'drink' and more 'hold'.; The smoke from the drink implies it has been sitting for a while, adding a slight duration cue."
"wizard_eat_apple","wizard","eat","irregular","v4",65.4,30,"maybe",45,"unclear","The apple is slightly too close to the mouth - feels more like he is about to eat it, rather than actively eating it.; Could benefit from a slightly more dynamic pose to cement the 'eating' action.; The beard position makes it hard to determine the actual 'eating' stage. Could be interpreted as just holding the apple"
"wizard_paint_canvas","wizard","paint","regular","v2",68.2,32,"keep",45,"unclear","The wizard is holding the brush, which is good, but the hand doesn't seem entirely in the middle of the act; it is somewhat still before it goes into the canvas.; The canvas is untouched and is still a 'blank canvas'.; The brush has nothing on it and doesn't seem to have been used for this image."
"wizard_peel_banana","wizard","peel","regular","v1",88.6,31,"maybe",,"unclear","The bananas are peeled, so it's possible the action of peeling has already happened (completion).; The wizard is holding bananas, not doing anything with them, so the 'mid-action' score suffers.; It feels slightly more natural to say 'The wizard will peel bananas' than 'The wizard peeled bananas' because of the peeled state of the fruit."

"wizard_smell_flower","wizard","smell","regular","v2",66.8,31,"maybe",45,"unclear","The wizard is merely holding the flower. The action of "smelling" isn't visually represented; he's not sniffing, no nose near the flower, facial expression lacks the action."
