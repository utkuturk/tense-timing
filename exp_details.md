**Tense Experiment**

**Overall Goal:** Test dissociation between syntactic (tense feature/diacritic selection) and phonological (morph realization) planning.  
**Limited Goal for Exp1:** Establish that the entropy-manipulation (switch task) is working as intended.  
**Follow-up:** Somehow include past/present tense difference, and maybe another follow up where we include control for conceptual past tense.  
**Switch Logic:** Participants will be given items in a block when all of them follow the same style, we expect some sort of cumulative facilitation (Oppenheim style). 

| Block | Prediction | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| No Switch(Regular \+ Past) | Faster onset & preverbal times | Repeated “-ed” morphology provides facilitation |
| No Switch(Irregular \+ Past) | Longer preverbal times vs. Block 1 | No shared morphology, suppletive forms controlled, but still there is a shared “irregularity” |
| Switch (Regular \+ Irregular \+ Past) | Even longer preverbal times vs. Block 1; increased entropy | Switching reduces predictability; participants must attend to morphophonological cues |

**Trial flow**

- cross fixation → scene \+ timeline cue → delete the scene → spoken description.  
- Responses target simple clauses with past tense (e.g., ‘The wizard **talked**’ or ‘The wizard **ran**’).

**Possible Verbs:** see next page. All unergatives. (should I include unaccusatives? Probably not.)

**Measures & Predictions**

- **Onset time:** time between the cue and at the end of the article *the*. No expected difference between blocks.  
- **Preverbal time:** Block 2 and 3 should be longer than Block 1

**Counterbalancing**

- **Irregulars:** try to use different styles of irregulars, i.e. hit, swam, brought, slept, broke, went, stood. So that there is no morphophonological priming.  
- **Block order:** randomize it  
- **Block 3 items:** The last block is going to be longer than the rest.   
- Did not want to match them concept wise because it would increase codability difficulty, but wanted to match them for frequency.
