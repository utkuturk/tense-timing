# Verb Selection for Tense-Timing Experiment

## The Problem

I already created some verb-picture pairs that work well for the regular/irregular distinction. However, there's an aspectual problem: some verbs are **punctual/achievement verbs** — they denote instantaneous events where the action happens at a single point in time.

For example, with "hit": the moment you hit something, the action is complete. Before contact, it's clearly "will hit" (future). After contact, it's "hit" (past). There's no ambiguous middle state where you could reasonably describe it as either past or future.

**What we need:** Verbs with **durative/activity aspect** — where even in the middle of the event, a participant could plausibly say "will X," "is X-ing," or "X-ed" depending on the cue. The picture should show an ongoing action that doesn't force a particular tense interpretation.

## Problematic Verbs (Punctual/Achievement)

These verbs are problematic because the action happens at a single moment:

| Verb | Type | Problem |
|------|------|---------|
| **break** | Irregular | Once the stick breaks, it's broken. The breaking moment is instantaneous. |
| **throw** | Irregular | The release is a single moment. Before release = future, after = past. |
| **cut** | Irregular | Each cut is a distinct punctual event. Mid-slice is ambiguous. |
| **kick** | Regular | The foot-ball contact is instantaneous. |
| **light** | Irregular | The ignition moment is punctual (lit/lighted). |
| **hammer** | Regular | Each strike is punctual (though repetitive hammering is durative). |

## Notes

- All recommended verbs describe **activities** (ongoing processes), not **achievements** (instantaneous completions)
- Pictures should show the character clearly **in the middle** of the action
- Avoid showing clear "before" (nothing started) or "after" (result visible) states
- The v3 version of pictures should be the canonical "mid-action" frame
