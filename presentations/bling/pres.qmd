## Theoretical Base

::: {.incremental}
* **Historically,** production models often treat morphology as a **"big glob"**.
* **Reality** is that we know that morphological elements behave differently (e.g., number agreement vs. tense vs. gender marking).
* **Theoretical Contributions:**
    * Processes and not just features are what differentiate these elements.
    * These processes work (mostly) without an immediate reference to the phonology.
:::

---

## Theoretical Goal

::: {.incremental}
* **The Big Question:** What are the subparts of morphology, and when exactly do we plan them?
* **Humble Goal:**
    * Can we show that different morphological processes have different planning timelines?
    * Can we also show a dissociation between:
        * **Early Morphosyntax** (feature assignment)
        * **Late Morphophonology** (form retrieval)
:::

## Evidence from Number Agreement

::: {.incremental}
* **888 Focus:** Used planning differences between unaccusative and unergative verbs.
    * Unaccusative (Verb planned early):
      * Planning: `[doctor + freeze] --> [pirate]`
      * Output: `[The doctor by the pirate is freezing]`
    * Unergative (Verb planned late):
      * Planning: `[doctor] --> [pirate] --> [run]`
      * Output: `[The doctor by the pirate is running]`
:::

---

## Evidence from Number Agreement

::: {.incremental}
* **Manipulation:** Introduced `pirate` vs. `pirates` (singular vs. plural attractor).
* **Key Findings:**
    * Attraction effects (errors) were the same for both verb types (i.e., **late** effect).
    * Onset latency (speech start time) was modulated by unaccusativity and number mismatch (**early** effect).
:::

---

## Evidence from Number Agreement

::: {.incremental}
* **Interpretation:**
    * Number diacritics were assigned when the verb was retrieved (*early* in unaccusatives),
    * but auxiliary retrieval (where attraction happens) occurred *late*.

## What About Other Morphological Elements?

::: {.incremental}
* **Tense is Different:** Unlike agreement, Tense is not a dependency between two elements; it's a **context-level element** dependent solely on the message being built. (ignore embedded sentences for now)
* **The Core Question:** Can we dissociate
  * **[PAST] feature assignment**
  * from its **morphological form selection** (*-ed* vs. irregular)?

### Plan

The overall experimental roadmap is structured in three phases:

1.  **Phase 1:** (Manipulating Regularity and Irregularity)
    - Establish **Morphophonological Priming** in sentence production.<br><br>
2.  **Phase 2:** (Manipulating Tense)
    - Establish **Morphosyntactic Priming** in sentence production.<br><br>
3.  **Phase 3:**  (Manipulating the Task)
    - Establish the **Dissociation between Morphosyntax and Conceptual Planning**.

---

### Initial Design Idea: Simple Blocks

::: {.incremental}
* **Task:** Sentence Production (for Phases 1 and 2).
* **Initial Stimulus Idea:** Participants memorize a small, fixed list of verbs (sublists for Future/Past in Phases 2 and 3).
* **Block Types:**
    * **Homogeneous Block:** High predictability, e.g., `[All Regulars] → [All Irregulars]`.
    * **Mixed Block:** Low predictability, i.e., random intermixing of all items.
:::

### Predictions Based on Simple Blocks

| Phase | Element Manipulated | Planning Stage | Predicted Advantage (Homogeneous vs. Mixed) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Regularity (Form)** | Late (Morphophonological) | **Preverbal Adv.** |
| **Phase 2** | **Tense (Feature)** | Early (Morphosyntactic) | **Onset Adv.** ⏱️ |

## A Problem: Conceptual Planning


::: {.incremental}
* **The Concern:** Is it theoretically interesting to show that phonology and a **compound conceptual + syntax** mechanism are planned at different times? We need to isolate syntax.
* **The Solution:** Run a **non-verbal decision task** (Schriefers et al., 1999 JML) to isolate conceptual planning.
* **Goal:** Participants must use the tense conceptual information but **not verbalize** the utterance.
* **Procedure:** Show a picture and ask participants to decide: "Was this event **Past** or **Future**?"

:::

---

### The Problem of Superfluous Predictability

::: {.incremental}
* **Issue:** The Decision Task is much **easier** (lower cognitive load) than Sentence Production.
* The simple Homogeneous/Mixed blocks (with trials $\geq 6$) might create **superfluous predictability** in the easy Decision Task.
* **Result:** Priming effects could be so strong that the "Mixed" block also starts to feel predictable, **washing out the critical block difference** needed for dissociation.
* Alternatively, the magnitude of conceptual predictability might be artificially amplified, increasing the RT differences.
* **Goal:** We need a block structure that controls **local context** more precisely to maintain the uncertainty contrast, even in an easy task.
:::

## Solution 1: Meyer/MPI-Style Cycled Blocks

This approach maintains the block contrast through controlled repetition.


### Block Structure Detail (Example: Regularity)

* **Constrained Sets:** Sets of **3 same-type verbs + 1 different-type verb**, cycling frequently (e.g., `{3 REG + 1 IRR}`).
* The last verb in the REG sequence is treated as the **"Homogeneous condition"**.
* The `+ 1` verb is taken to be the **"Mixed condition"**.
* **Implementation:** Will create 4 Sets (2: $3 \times \text{Reg} + 1 \times \text{Irr}$, and 2: $3 \times \text{Irr} + 1 \times \text{Reg}$). Cycle through them 6 or 8 times.

::: {.fragment}
**Worry:** Past studies show clear results with this method, but the sheer number of repetitions (e.g., $8 \times$ per verb) still creates concern about **over-automatization** in an easy decision task.
:::

---

## Solution 2: Local "Burst" Priming

This approach replaces the long block manipulation with a trial-by-trial local context manipulation.

### Strategy: Contextual Flashing
* **Pre-Trial Burst:** Participants see a fast-flashing sequence (a "burst") of 3 context pictures immediately before the target item appears.
* **Context Control:** The identity of the 3 context items determines the condition:
    * **Homogeneous:** Burst items share the same Tense/Regularity as the target.
    * **Mixed:** Burst items are a mix of Tense/Regularity.
* **Attention Check:** Catch trials are used (e.g., "Did you just see X?") to ensure participants process the items in the burst.

::: {.fragment}
**Advantage:** Provides tighter control over the immediate preceding context, potentially minimizing global learning confounds.

**Worry:** This is an **untested paradigm** for morphosyntactic priming; we must first validate that viewing images in a burst actually activates the necessary planning levels.
